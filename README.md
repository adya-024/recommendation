Duration: 4 Weeks

Mentor: NEELA SANTOSH

This Java-based Recommendation System suggests products or content based on user preferences using recommendation algorithms and libraries such as Apache Mahout. It is designed to help users discover relevant items based on their behavior or input. It is a great project for learners and developers who want to dive into recommendation engines and Javaâ€™s data handling capabilities.

### The Recommendation System includes the following features:

* User-Based or Item-Based Filtering: Implements collaborative filtering to suggest items based on similarity.
  
* Custom Preferences Input: Users can input their interests or past preferences for personalized suggestions.
  
* Dynamic Suggestions: Generates recommendations in real-time based on changing user data.
  
* Structured Output: Displays suggestions in a clean and understandable format.
  
* Integration with Libraries: Utilizes libraries such as Apache Mahout or employs simple algorithms for recommendation logic.


### Future Enhancements

We plan to improve the Java Recommendation System with:

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
  
* Content-Based Filtering for hybrid recommendations.
  
* Data Persistence to store user profiles and recommendation history.
  
* REST API Integration for scalable deployment.
  
* Machine Learning Algorithms for more advanced predictions.
